    <p class="edu"> Outside of tinkering with code whilst listening to listless new Podcasts, I busy myself with staying in the know about new scientific discoveries every day.
        After visiting my first planetarium as a kid, I fell in love with the stars and that love persisits today. At the age of 12 I came
        across the ever elusive topic of dark energy and dark matter and have been obsessed ever since. (I have probabaly read every source about it on the web and books alike).</p> 
        <p class="edu"> Along with my love for space, I also actively try to keep up with the newest shows on Broadway. As a Georgia Thespian taking a break from performing 
            it is truly inspiring to see such young artists on the rise and siezing their moment. It helps me remember that everyone is working towards something whether its learning to hit
            a new high note or just getting a code to run smoothly after a fifty runs. You just keep trying!
