       <p class="small"> As a computer science major driven by my passion for the intersectionality of education and technology, I find it hard to limit myself to just one area of interest. 
           With that in mind, not only do I love getting my hands dirty doing back end work (such as cleaning data and debugging code), but I equally enjoy taking time to make the perfect button with CSS, or perhaps even redesigning an entire sites UI.
           Every day I strive to become a better UI/UX designer and software developer to ensure that not only are consumers getting the information and products that they need from a site, but that it’s easy to find and comprehend regardless of one’s background or level of education.</p>
